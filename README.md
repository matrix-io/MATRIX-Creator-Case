# MATRIX-Creator-Case

![alt tag](https://github.com/matrix-io/MATRIX-Creator-Case/blob/master/IMG_2971.JPG)

A two part case to protect your Raspberry Pi and MATRIX Creator. It allows you to access all of the Raspberry Pi's ports and does not obstruct any of the MATRIX Creator's sensors. It also has a hole on the bottom to attach it to a tripod screw mount.

We recommend using an M3 screw for all 7 screw holes.


If you do not own a 3D printer then you can use [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com) to find a local 3D printer for hire.

For MATRIX Voice there is a similar case made by gapdev user:
